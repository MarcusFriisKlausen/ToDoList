This is a very simple To Do List application written in React. It is my first time working with React, and it was therefore created with the intention of getting to know the framework.

In the application, you can write a task, which can be added by pressing the plus button. You can then click on the task to remove it.

I've been running the app via Expo, by running the command "npx expo start", to start a local server, which can be opened on the Expo Go app.
